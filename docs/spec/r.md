# R extension

How to put R-based analyses in an ERC.

The ERC MUST contain one weaved document which integrates text and code and can be compiled into an interaction file.

The weaved document SHOULD have one of the following formats for executable documents:

- [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
- Sweave

The interaction file SHOULD be `HTML`.
