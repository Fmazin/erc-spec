# Glossary

## (Computational) Analysis

A scientific workflow that is to be preserved in an ERC. It conducts a number of operations on data and generates an output (text, numbers, plots).

## Bag

See [BagIt specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kunze-bagit).

> A set of opaque data contained within the structure defined by this specification.

## Compendium contents

See [ERC contents](#erc-contents)

## Container

A receptacle holding a collection of things ("payload" or "contents"). In the context of this specification, several of such containers are distinguished: [runtime container](#runtime-container), [outer container](#outer-container), and [Docker container](#docker-container).

<!-- See also [bundle](#bundle). -->

## Create

One of the major constituents of ERC interaction. The user can create an ERC by following the technical instructions included in the Specification (ERC Spec) or use the o2r reproducibility service, that has been referentially implemented as "o2r platform".
For more information, see [erc-spec/user-guide/creation/]

## Discover

One of the major constituents of ERC interaction. Discovery comprises the findability of the ERC as well as the exploration of its features, e.g. time and space driven search operations.

## Docker container

TBD

## ERC

Executable Research Compendium, see [this article](https://doi.org/10.1045/january2017-nuest)

## ERC contents

The file created by the author of the original analysis.

## ERC metadata

Schema compliant information about the ERC, its contents and creators.

## Examine

One of the major constituents of ERC interaction. It comprises Check, Inspect, Manipilate and Substitute.
To examine an ERC means to explore its contents in depth, i.e. check the reproduced version, inspect text, code and data, as well as manipulate interactive elements.
In addition to that with substitution, compatible parts of an ERC may be exchanged, e.g. similar data sets for a given analysis.

## Inner container

See [runtime container](#runtime-container)

## Interaction file

The file in the container that a reader opens using a suitable tool to read the text and explore the graphics.

## OAIS

The Open Archival Information System and its reference model.

## Outer container

TBD

## Reproducible, Reproducibility, Replication

See [section 2.1 "Definition of Reproducibility"](https://doi.org/10.1045/january2017-nuest).

## Runtime container

TBD

## UI bindings
