# ERC preservation aspects in the light of OAIS

The Open Archival Information System (OAIS) reference model is a framework for the preservation and dissimination of digital objects (assets). It has been created by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) and  has since been adopted by a wide range of international institutions. The OAIS provides the terminology and concept of the _information package_ as primitive of the digital preservation workflow. Submission information packages (SIP), Dissimination information packages (DIP) and Archival information packages (AIP) refer to different functional roles of a digital object during (long term) preservation.

The representation information object within OAIS consists of structural and semantic information and is itself linked to other units of representation information, building a representation network. The information contained within the ERC and its metadata serves as representation information and enables the interpretability of the archived software, environment, code, data, text and UI bindings. Standards used for representation are included as local copy of the underlying schema and as reference to their persistent identifiers. The network of information objects describes how the parts of the ERC relate to each other and how they are to be used and understood.
