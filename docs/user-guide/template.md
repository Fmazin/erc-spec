# User guide: ERC template - WORK IN PROGRESS

If you want to create an ERC for your research already at the beginning, and not "post-hoc" after your research is complete, these templates can hopefully help.
They are divided into specific domains to be more concrete.

**Files in this template**

- `document.md` use RMarkdown, this is the main document
  - fill out the metadata fields in the yaml header of this document
- `erc.yml` is template for the ERC configuration file with placeholders for all required fields
- `Dockerfile` is a template Dockerfile with some commands you can re-use to make sure all packages and tools that you need are installed
