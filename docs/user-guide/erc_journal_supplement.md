# User guide: The ERC as journal supplement

To facilitate integration into open access journals, the ERC can serve as a supplement for a journal article. In that use case it would not contain the text part of the publication but be attached to it instead.

When the ERC is attached as supplement, it is important to make sure
the results are still findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, following the FAIR principles.
An ERC as supplement is still a formally complete ERC and as such it satisfies these important requirements of reproducible research.
