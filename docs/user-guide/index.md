# ERC user guide

This user guide comprises instructions how to create an ERC by hand.
It thus limited to mandatory elements in some places.
However, a fundamental goal of the ERC specification is to be simple enough to allow manualy ERC creation as demonstrated in this document.
For using tools or services for creation and validation of ERCs, please see the [developer guide](../dev-guide/index.md).
