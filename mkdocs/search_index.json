The name of the base directory MUST only contain characters, numbers, \n_\n (underscore) and \n-\n (minus sign).\nThat directory is part of the \nbundle\n.\nIn other words, an archive of an ERC will have one top-level directory with the name of the base directory.\n\n\nRegular expression\n for base directory name: \n[a-zA-Z0-9\\-_]\n\n\nThe base directory MUST contain an \nERC configuration file\n.\n\n\nBesides the files mentioned in this specification, the base directory may contain any other file and directories.\n\n\nERC configuration file\n\n\nThe ERC configuration file is the \nreproducibility manifest\n for an ERC. It defines the main entry points for actions performed on an ERC and core metadata elements.\n\n\nName, format, and encoding\n\n\nThe filename MUST be \nerc.yml\n and it MUST be located in the base directory.\nThe contents MUST be valid \nYAML 1.2\n.\nThe file MUST be encoded in \nUTF-8\n and MUST NOT contain a byte-order mark (BOM).\n\n\nRequired fields\n\n\nThe first document content of this file MUST contain the following string nodes at the root level.\n\n\n\n\nspec-version\n: a text string noting the version of the used ERC specification. The appropriate version for an ERC conforming to this version of the specification is \n1\n.\n\n\nid\n: globally unique identifier for a specific ERC. This SHOULD be a URI (see \nrfc3986\n) or a \nUUID\n, Version 4.\n\n\n\n\nMinimal example:\n\n\nid: b9b0099e-9f8d-4a33-8acf-cb0c062efaec\nversion: 1\n\n\n\n\nControl statements\n\n\nThe configuration file can contain \nbash\n statements to control the runtime container.\n\n\nThese statements MUST be in an array under the node \ncommand\n under the root-level node \nexecution\n in the ERC configuration file.\n\n\nDefault command statements of implementing tools MUST be as shown in the following example configuration file.\n\n\nid: b9b0099e-9f8d-4a33-8acf-cb0c062efaec\nversion: 1\nexecution:\n  command:\n    - `docker load --input image.tar`\n    - `docker run -it -e TZ=CET erc:b9b0099e-9f8d-4a33-8acf-cb0c062efaec`\n\n\n\n\nThe exectution statements SHOULD ensure, that the re-computation is independent from the environment that may be different depending on the host.\nThis includes, for example, setting the time zone via an environment variable \n-e TZ=CET\n so that output formatting of timestamps does not break validation.\nThis can also be handled by the ERC author on script level.\n\n\nDiscovery metadata\n\n\nauthor\ntitle\ndescription\n. . .\n\n\nThe discovery metadata MUST be compliant to the o2r-metadata schema.\n\n\nLicense metadata\n\n\nerc.yml\n MUST contain a first level node \nlicenses\n with licensing information for the code, data, and text contained.\nEach of these three have distinct requirements, hence different licenses need to be applied.\n\n\nThe node \nlicenses\n MUST have three children: \ncode\n, \ndata\n, \ntext\n.\n\n\n\nThere is currently no mechanism to define the licenses of the used libraries, as manual creation would be tedious.\nTools for automatic creation of ERC may add such detailed licensing information and define an extension to the ERC \n\n\n\n\nThe content of each of these child nodes MUST be one of the following\n\n\n\n\ntext string with license identifier or license text. This SHOULD be a standardized identifier of an existing license as defined by the \nOpen Definition Licenses Service\n.\n\n\na dictionary of all files or directories and their respective license, each of the values following the previous statement. The node values are the file paths relative to the base directory.\n\n\n\n\nExample for global licenses:\n\n\nid: b9b0099e-9f8d-4a33-8acf-cb0c062efaec\nversion: 1\nlicenses:\n  code: \"Apache-2.0\"\n  data: \"ODbL-1.0\"\n  text: \"CC0-1.0\"\n\n\n\n\nExample using specific licenses for files:\n\n\n---\nid: b9b0099e-9f8d-4a33-8acf-cb0c062efaec\nversion: 1\nlicenses:\n  code:\n    Dockerfile: MIT\n    my_code: GPL-3.0\n  text:\n    README.md: CC0-1.0\n    paper/chapter01.doc: CC-BY-4.0\n    paper/chapter02.tex: CC-BY-4.0\n\n\n\n\n\nIt IS NOT possible to assign one license to a directory and override that assignment or a single file within that directory, NOR IS it possible to use globs or regular expressions.\n\n\n\n\nSoftware metadata\n\n\nAn ERC SHOULD provide a machine readable list of software that is contained.\nThis list can have different formats for different use cases or depending on the source of information, which is probably a tool rather than manual creation.\nThe information can also be quite extensive.\n\n\nTherefore this information MUST NOT be included in the ERC configuration file but SHOULD be referenced from there to support implementing tools.\n\n\nThe software metadata documents, if present, MUST be listed as paths relative to the base directory.\n\n\nInformation on the format of the files SHOULD be conveyed to both human and machine users based on file name and file extension.\n\n\nFurther details are unspecified here but could be defined in specification extensions.\n\n\n---\nid: b9b0099e-9f8d-4a33-8acf-cb0c062efaec\nversion: 1\nmetadata:\n  software:\n    - .erc/software_codemeta.json\n    - dpkg--list.txt\n\n\n\n\nExtension metadata\n\n\nIf an extension of the specification is used, it MUST be put into a list under the root-level node \nextensions\n.\n\n\n---\nid: b9b0099e-9f8d-4a33-8acf-cb0c062efaec\nversion: 1\nextensions:\n  - extension_name_1\n  - \"yet another extension\"\n\n\n\n\nThis list SHOULD be used by implementations that support these extensions to comply with validation checks or processes as defined by the extensions.\n\n\nIf an extension creates additional (custom) metadata fields, they MUST NOT interfere with the structure defined in this document.\nHowever, it is unspecified into which root node or nodes of the ERC configuration file these metadata should go.\n\n\nRuntime container file\n\n\nThe base directory MUST contain a \ntarball\n of a Docker image as created be the command \ndocker save\n, see \nDocker CLI save command documentation\n.\n\n\nThe file SHOULD be named \nimage.tar\n.\n\n\nThe output of the container during execution can be shown to the user to convey detailed information.\n\n\nRuntime container manifest\n\n\nThe base directory MUST contain a valid Dockerfile, see \nDockerfile reference\n.\nThe Dockerfile MUST contain the build instructions for the runtime environment and MUST have been used to create the image saved to the \nruntime container file\n using \ndocker build\n, see \nDocker CLI build command documentation\n.\nThe build SHOULD be done with the option \n--no-cache=true\n.\n\n\nThe file SHOULD be named \nDockerfile\n.\n\n\nThe Dockerfile MUST contain the required instruction \nFROM\n, which MUST NOT use the \nlatest\n tag.\n\n\nThe Dockerfile SHOULD contain the instruction \nMAINTAINER\n to provide copyright information.\n\n\nThe Dockerfile MUST have an active instruction \nCMD\n, or a combination of the instructions \nENTRYPOINT\n and \nCMD\n, which executes the packaged analysis.\n\n\nThe Dockerfile MUST NOT contain \nEXPOSE\n instructions.\n\n\nThe Dockerfile MUST contain a \nVOLUME\n instruction to define the mount point of the ERC within the container.\nThis mountpoint SHOULD be \n/erc\n.\nIf the mountpoint is different from \n/erc\n, the value MUST be defined in \nerc.yml\n in a node \nexecution.mountpoint\n.\n\n\nExample for the mountpoint configuration:\n\n\n---\nid: b9b0099e-9f8d-4a33-8acf-cb0c062efaec\nversion: 1\nexecution:\n  mountpoint: \"/erc\"\n\n\n\n\nMetadata in container manifest - \nUnder development\n\n\n... use \nLABEL\n and \nENV\n installations?\n\n\n.ercignore file\n\n\nThe ERC MAY contain a file named \n.ercignore\n in the base directory.\nIf this file is present, any files and directories matching the patterns within that file will be excluded from processes such as validation.\nThe newline-separated patterns in the file will be treated as \nUnix shell globs\n.\n\n\nValidation\n\n\nERC validation comprises four steps:\n\n\n\n\nchecking required metadata elements\n\n\nexecuting the runtime container\n\n\ncomparing the results of the runtime container execution with the original files\n\n\nrunning checks of used extensions\n\n\n\n\nThe comparison step SHOULD be based on \nmd5\n checksums and compare recursively all files that are \nreasonable to hash as a comparison\n.\n\n\nThe validation MUST NOT fail when files listed in \n.ercignore\n are failing comparison.\n\n\nThe following \nmedia types\n are a regular expressions of file formats that SHALL be used (unless ignored) for comparison:\n\n\n\n\ntext/*\n\n\napplication/json\n\n\n*+xml\n\n\n*+json\n\n\n\n\nSee \nIANA's full list of media types\n.\n\n\nSecurity considerations\n\n\nWhy are ERC not a security risk?\n\n\n\n\nthe spec prohibits use of \nEXPOSE\n\n\nthe containers are only executed \nwithout\n external network access using \nNetwork: none\n, see \nDocker CLI run documentation\n\n\n\n\nSecondary metadata files\n\n\nAn ERC can be an object in several use cases.\nFor example, it can be an item under review during a journal publication, it can be the actual publication at a workshop or conference, it can be a preserved item in a research repository.\nAll of these probably have their own standards and requirements when it comes to metadata.\nThese metadata requirements are \nnot\n part of this specification, but the following conventions should simplify their (re-)use.\n\n\nDomain or use case specific metadata SHOULD replicate all and only the information required for the specific case.\n\n\nMetadata documents of specific use cases SHOULD be stored in a directory \n.erc\n in the base directory.\n\n\nThey SHOULD be named according to the used standard or platform, and the used format, e.g. \ndatacite.xml\n or \nzenodo_sandbox.json\n.\n\n\nComprehensive example of erc.yml\n\n\nThe following example shows all possible fields and their default values of the core specification.\n\n\nid: b9b0099e-9f8d-4a33-8acf-cb0c062efaec\nversion: 1\nstructure:\n  payload_directory: \"data\"\n  config_file: \"erc.yml\"\n  container_file: \"image.tar\"\n  container_manifest: \"Dockerfile\"\nexecution:\n  mountpoint: \"/erc\"\n  command: \"rmarkdown::render(input = 'paper.Rmd', output_format = )\"\nlicenses:\n  ...",
