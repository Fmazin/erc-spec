The name of the base directory MUST only contain characters, numbers, \n_\n (underscore) and \n-\n (minus sign).\nThat directory is part of the \nbundle\n.\nIn other words, an archive of an ERC will have one top-level directory with the name of the base directory.\n\n\nRegular expression\n for base directory name: \n[a-zA-Z0-9\\-_]\n\n\nThe base directory MUST contain an \nERC configuration file\n.\n\n\nBesides the files mentioned in this specification, the base directory may contain any other file and directories.\n\n\nMain document & display file\n\n\nAn ERC MUST have a \nmain document\n, i.e. the file which contains the text and instructions being the basis for the scientific publication describing the packaged analysis.\nThe main document's name SHOULD be \nmain\n with an appropriate extension and media type.\nFor example if the main document is RMarkdown, then the extension should be \n.Rmd\n and the media type \ntext/markdown\n.\n\n\nAn ERC MUST have a \ndisplay file\n, i.e. the file which is shown to the user first when he opens an ERC in a supporting platform or tool.\nThe display file's name SHOULD be \nview\n with an appropriate extension and media type.\nFor example if the main document is Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), then the extension should be \n.htm\n or \n.html\n and the media type \ntext/html\n.\n\n\nThe display file is often \"rendered\" from the main file.\n\n\nNested runtime\n\n\nThe embedding of a representation of the original runtime environment, in which an analysis was conducted, is crucial for supporting reproducible computations.\nThis section defines two such representations.\nFirst, an executable image.\nSecond, a manifest documenting the image's contents.\n\n\nThe format of these representations is undefined here and can be stated more precisely in an extension to this specification.\n\n\nA concrete runtime extension may choose to (a) embed the runtime environment in the image, or (b) to rely on constructing the runtime environment from the manifest.\n\n\nRuntime environment or image\n\n\nThe base directory SHOULD contain a runnable image, e.g. a \"binary\", of the original analysis environment that can be used to re-run the packaged analysis using a suitable software.\n\n\nThe image file may be compressed.\nIt SHOULD be named \nimage\n with an appropriate extension, such as \n.tar\n or \n.bin\n, and have an appropriate mime type, e.g. \napplication/vnd.oci.image.layer.tar+gzip\n.\n\n\nThe output of the image execution can be shown to the user to convey detailed information on progress or errors.\n\n\nRuntime manifest\n\n\nThe base directory MUST contain a complete, self-consistent manifest of the runtime image's contents.\n\n\nThis manifest MUST be in a machine-readable format that allows a respective tool to create the runtime image.\n\n\nA concrete runtime extension MUST define the command to create the runnable environment from the manifest.\n\n\nRuntime manipulation\n\n\nBundling a complete runtime gives the possibility to manipulate the contained workflow or exchange data.\n\n\nThe manipulation parameters SHOULD be defined in a concrete runtime extension.\n\n\nThe data replacement proccess SHOULD be define in a concrete runtime extension.\n\n\nERC configuration file\n\n\nThe ERC configuration file is the \nreproducibility manifest\n for an ERC. It defines the main entry points for actions performed on an ERC and core metadata elements.\n\n\nName, format, and encoding\n\n\nThe filename MUST be \nerc.yml\n and it MUST be located in the base directory.\nThe contents MUST be valid \nYAML 1.2\n.\nThe file MUST be encoded in \nUTF-8\n and MUST NOT contain a byte-order mark (BOM).\n\n\nRequired fields\n\n\nThe first document content of this file MUST contain the following string nodes at the root level.\n\n\n\n\nspec_version\n: a text string noting the version of the used ERC specification. The appropriate version for an ERC conforming to this version of the specification is \n1\n.\n\n\nid\n: globally unique identifier for a specific ERC. This SHOULD be a URI (see \nrfc3986\n) or a \nUUID\n, Version 4.\n\n\n\n\nMinimal example:\n\n\nid: b9b0099e-9f8d-4a33-8acf-cb0c062efaec\nspec_version: 1\n\n\n\n\nThe main and display file can be defined in root-level nodes named \nmain\n and \ndisplay\n respectively:\n\n\nid: b9b0099e-9f8d-4a33-8acf-cb0c062efaec\nspec_version: 1\nmain: the_paper_document.odt\ndisplay: output.html\n\n\n\n\nControl statements\n\n\nThe configuration file MUST contain \nbash\n statements to control the runtime container.\n\n\nThese statements MUST be in an array under the node \ncommand\n under the root-level node \nexecution\n in the ERC configuration file.\n\n\nDefault command statements SHOULD be defined by an extension for a working ERC.\n\n\nThe exectution statements SHOULD ensure, that the re-computation is independent from the environment that may be different depending on the host.\nThis includes, for example, setting the time zone via an environment variable \n-e TZ=CET\n so that output formatting of timestamps does not break validation.\nThis can also be handled by the ERC author on script level.\n\n\nExample control statements:\n\n\nid: b9b0099e-9f8d-4a33-8acf-cb0c062efaec\nspec_version: 1\nexecution:\n  command:\n    - `./prepare.sh --input my_data`\n    - `./execute.sh --output results --iterations 3`\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery metadata\n\n\nauthor\ntitle\ndescription\n. . .\n\n\nThe discovery metadata MUST be compliant to the o2r-metadata schema.\n\n\nLicense metadata\n\n\nerc.yml\n MUST contain a first level node \nlicenses\n with licensing information for the code, data, and text contained.\nEach of these three have distinct requirements, hence different licenses need to be applied.\n\n\nThe node \nlicenses\n MUST have three children: \ncode\n, \ndata\n, \ntext\n.\n\n\n\nThere is currently no mechanism to define the licenses of the used libraries, as manual creation would be tedious.\nTools for automatic creation of ERC may add such detailed licensing information and define an extension to the ERC \n\n\n\n\nThe content of each of these child nodes MUST be one of the following\n\n\n\n\ntext string with license identifier or license text. This SHOULD be a standardized identifier of an existing license as defined by the \nOpen Definition Licenses Service\n.\n\n\na dictionary of all files or directories and their respective license, each of the values following the previous statement. The node values are the file paths relative to the base directory.\n\n\n\n\nExample for global licenses:\n\n\nid: b9b0099e-9f8d-4a33-8acf-cb0c062efaec\nspec_version: 1\nlicenses:\n  code: \"Apache-2.0\"\n  data: \"ODbL-1.0\"\n  text: \"CC0-1.0\"\n\n\n\n\nExample using specific licenses for files:\n\n\n---\nid: b9b0099e-9f8d-4a33-8acf-cb0c062efaec\nspec_version: 1\nlicenses:\n  code:\n    others_lib.bin: MIT\n    my_code.c: GPL-3.0\n  text:\n    README.md: CC0-1.0\n    paper/chapter01.doc: CC-BY-4.0\n    paper/chapter02.tex: CC-BY-4.0\n\n\n\n\n\nIt IS NOT possible to assign one license to a directory and override that assignment or a single file within that directory, NOR IS it possible to use globs or regular expressions.\n\n\n\n\nSoftware metadata\n\n\nAn ERC SHOULD provide a machine readable list of software that is contained in the runtime environment to support reproducibility in case the runtime image and manifest are not usable anymore.\nThis list can have different formats for different use cases or depending on the source of information, which is probably a tool rather than manual creation, for example package managers.\nThe information can also be quite extensive.\n\n\nTherefore this information MUST NOT be included in the ERC configuration file but SHOULD be referenced from there to support implementing tools.\nThe metadata documents MUST be listed as paths relative to the base directory and MUST be plain text files.\n\n\nInformation on the format of the files SHOULD be conveyed to human users based on file name and file extension, for example \ndpkg_installed-package-list.txt\n.\n\n\nFurther details are unspecified here.\n\n\nExample for software metadata file listing in the ERC configuration file.\n\n\n---\nid: b9b0099e-9f8d-4a33-8acf-cb0c062efaec\nspec_version: 1\nmetadata:\n  software:\n    - .erc/software_codemeta.json\n    - dpkg--list.txt\n\n\n\n\nExtension metadata\n\n\nIf an extension of the specification is used, it MUST be put into a list under the root-level node \nextensions\n.\n\n\n---\nid: b9b0099e-9f8d-4a33-8acf-cb0c062efaec\nspec_version: 1\nextensions:\n  - extension_name_1\n  - \"yet another extension\"\n\n\n\n\nThis list SHOULD be used by implementations that support these extensions to comply with validation checks or processes as defined by the extensions.\n\n\nIf an implementation encounters an unsupported extension it MUST issue a user level warning.\n\n\nIf an implementation supports an extension it MUST use default settings, for example for control commands, as defined in the extension.\n\n\nIf an extension creates additional (custom) metadata fields, they MUST NOT interfere with the structure defined in this document.\nHowever, it is unspecified into which root node or nodes of the ERC configuration file these metadata should go.\n\n\n.ercignore file\n\n\nThe ERC MAY contain a file named \n.ercignore\n in the base directory.\nIf this file is present, any files and directories within the outer container which match the patterns within the file \n.ercignore\n will be excluded from the validation process.\nThe newline-separated patterns in the file MUST be \nUnix shell globs\n.\n\n\nTools implementing this specification SHOULD communicate the names of ignored files or directories to the user for a transparent validation procedure.\n\n\nValidation\n\n\nERC validation comprises four steps:\n\n\n\n\nchecking required metadata elements\n\n\nexecuting the runtime container\n\n\ncomparing the output files of the runtime container execution with the original output files in the outer container\n\n\nrunning checks of active extensions\n\n\n\n\nThe comparison step (\n3.\n) SHOULD be based on \nmd5\n checksums and compare recursively all files that are \nreasonable to compare with hashes\n, for example text-based documents but not compressed pictures.\n\n\nThe validation MUST NOT fail when files listed in \n.ercignore\n are failing comparison.\n\n\nThe following \nmedia types\n (see \nIANA's full list of media types\n) are a regular expressions of file formats that SHALL be used (unless ignored) for comparison:\n\n\n\n\ntext/*\n\n\napplication/json\n\n\n*+xml\n\n\n*+json\n\n\n\n\nThe validation SHOULD communicate all files and directories actually used for validation to the user to avoid malicious usage of an \n.ercignore\n file.\n\n\nSecurity considerations\n\n\nWhy are ERC not a security risk?\n\n\n\n\nthe spec prohibits use of \nEXPOSE\n\n\nthe containers are only executed \nwithout\n external network access using \nNetwork: none\n, see \nDocker CLI run documentation\n\n\n\n\nSecondary metadata files\n\n\nAn ERC can be an object in very diverse use cases.\nFor example, it can be an item under review during a journal publication, it can be the actual publication at a workshop or conference, it can be a preserved item in a digital archive.\nAll of these have their own standards and requirements when it comes to metadata.\nThese metadata requirements are \nnot\n part of this specification, but the following conventions are made to simplify and coordinate the variety.\n\n\nMetadata specific to a particular domain or use case MUST replicate the information required for the specific case in an independent file.\nDomain metadata SHOULD follow domain conventions and standards regarding format and encoding of metadata.\nDuplicate information is accepted, because it lowers the entry barrier for domain experts and systems, who can simply pick up a metadata copy in a format known to them.\n\n\nMetadata documents of specific use cases MUST be stored in a directory \n.erc\n, which is a child-directory of the ERC base directory.\n\n\nMetadata documents SHOULD be named according to the used standard or platform, and the used format respectively encoding, e.g. \ndatacite.xml\n or \nzenodo_sandbox.json\n, and SHOULD use a suitable mime type.\n\n\nComprehensive example of erc.yml\n\n\nThe following example shows all possible fields of the core specification with example values.\n\n\nid: b9b0099e-9f8d-4a33-8acf-cb0c062efaec\nspec_version: 1\nmetadata:\n  software:\n    -
